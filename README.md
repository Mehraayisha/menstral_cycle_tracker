https://github.com/Mehraayisha/menstral_cycle_tracker

### Project Description
My project is a comprehensive menstrual cycle tracker and health assistant that predicts incoming cycles, tracks current cycles, and marks them on a calendar. It also features a progress bar, AI chatbot, nearby doctors search, and a self-care page with tips and videos for managing periods.

### The Problem statement
Periods can be unpredictable and stressful, and many people struggle to track and manage their cycles effectively. Finding the right menstrual products, doctors, and self-care advice can also be a hassle.

### The Solution
We’ve created a fun, easy-to-use platform that not only tracks your cycle but also predicts upcoming periods and provides personalized self-care tips. Plus, it helps you find nearby gynecologists, shop for menstrual products, and connects you with an AI chatbot for any questions—basically everything you need to make your period a little easier!
